Detection and Classification of Images with audio output on Pi2

Simple App to capture a frame from your Raspberry Pi camera, detect frames using eiter openCV or dlib and classify the face with help of VGGFace (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/) or GoogleNet (https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf).

Additional files are for supporting audio output after classifying a image. Future versions should include speech recognition to interact with detected persons.
